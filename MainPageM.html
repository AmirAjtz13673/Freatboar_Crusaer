        Oh, you think you can play guitar? Well, congratulations, you can strum
        a few power chords and maybe even play some riffs from your favorite
        metal songs. But let me tell you something, kiddo, that's not enough to
        make it in the world of metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to advance further playing metal, you're going to have to
        step up your game. You need to master the art of shredding, nail those
        complex solos, and develop a sense of rhythm that would make even the
        gods of metal proud. And let's not forget about your tone - it better be
        heavy, brutal, and melt faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the thing, it's not going to be easy. You're going to have to
        put in the hours of practice, endure the pain of calloused fingers, and
        face the criticism of your bandmates when you mess up. But if you truly
        want to shred like the greats, then you better be willing to pay the
        price. So, buckle up and get ready to shred, because the world of metal
        is waiting for you to take it by storm.

        Alright, metalheads, are you ready to take your guitar playing to the
        next level? Let's get started with this no-nonsense tutorial on how to
        advance further playing metal. First things first, you need to master
        the basics. That means practicing your scales, chords, and arpeggios
        until your fingers bleed. And no, I'm not talking about just playing
        them up and down the fretboard. I mean really understanding the theory
        behind them and how they relate to each other.
      </p>
      <button onclick="toggleContainer2()">Next</button>
    </div>
    <script>
      function toggleContainer2() {
        var container = document.getElementById("container3");
        if (container.style.display === "none") {
          container.style.display = "block";
        } else {
          container.style.display = "none";
        }
      }
    </script>
    <div id="container3" style="display: none">
      <p>
        Next up, it's time to focus on your technique. That means working on
        your picking, legato, and alternate picking until you can play
        lightning-fast without even breaking a sweat. And don't forget about
        your vibrato - it's the secret sauce that separates the good from the
        great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you've got the basics down and your technique is on point, it's
        time to start learning some metal songs. And I don't mean just the easy
        ones - I'm talking about the shredders like Yngwie Malmsteen, Jason
        Becker, and Marty Friedman. Study their solos and riffs, dissect them,
        and make them your own.
      </p>
      <button onclick="toggleContainer3()">Next</button>
    </div>
    <script>
      function toggleContainer3() {
        var container = document.getElementById("container4");
        if (container.style.display === "none") {
          container.style.display = "block";
        } else {
          container.style.display = "none";
        }
      }
    </script>
    <div id="container4" style="display: none">
      <p>
        But wait, there's more. You can't just play other people's songs all
        day. You need to start writing your own material. That means coming up
        with killer riffs, mind-blowing solos, and catchy hooks that will have
        audiences headbanging for days. And don't be afraid to experiment -
        metal is all about pushing boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, it's time to focus on your tone. This is where the
        magic happens. You need to dial in a tone that's heavy, brutal, and will
        melt faces. Experiment with different amps, pedals, and pickups until
        you find the perfect combination that will make your guitar sound like a
        beast.
      </p>
      <button onclick="toggleContainer4()">Next</button>
    </div>
    <script>
      function toggleContainer4() {
        var container = document.getElementById("container5");
        if (container.style.display === "none") {
          container.style.display = "block";
        } else {
          container.style.display = "none";
        }
      }
    </script>
    <div id="container5" style="display: none">
      <p>
        So, there you have it, folks. Follow these steps, put in the hours of
        practice, and soon enough, you'll be shredding like a pro. And who
        knows, maybe one day you'll be up on stage, melting faces and living the
        metal dream.
